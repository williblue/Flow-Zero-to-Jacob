# Chapter 1.0 Quests

## Day 1 

#### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
Blockchain is a decentralized database that anyone can make use of. 
All transactions are recorded and stored in every database in the network which makes it
very transparent and almost impossible to corrupt previous data. 

#### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.
A Smart Contract is a program that runs automatically when written conditions on the Smart Contract is met. 
It can be viewed as a written agreement in a code format. 

#### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
A script is used to read data on the Blockchain from a specific Smart Contract.
A transaction is used to add/edit/remove data on the Blockchain from a specific Smart Contract.

## Day 2

#### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
1. Safety and Security
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

#### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
1. Safety and Security: Cadance is built in a way that helps to avoid potential vulnerabilities in Smart contracts.
2. Clarity: Developer friendly as it also sets clear guidelines. It is already hard to read your own code most of the time.. not to mention reading others. 
3. Approachability: Developers that know other programming languages can easily learn Cadance because Cadance has some similar syntax as other programming languages. 
4. Developer Experience: Clear error message saves time and increases understanding of what went wrong in the code instead of trying to understand what the error message is trying to tell you.
