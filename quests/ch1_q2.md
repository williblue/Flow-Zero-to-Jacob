## Chapter 1.0 - Day 2 Quests

### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
1. Safety and Security
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
1. Safety and Security: Cadance makes it more difficult for developers to make mistakes.
2. Clarity: Developer friendly as it also sets clear guidelines. It is already hard to read your own code most of the time.. not to mention reading others. 
3. Approachability: Developers that know other programming languages can easily learn Cadance because Cadance has some similar syntax as other programming languages. 
4. Developer Experience: Clear error message saves time and increases understanding of what went wrong in the code instead of trying to understand what the error message is trying to tell you.
